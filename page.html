        <p>
            In my life i've the worst experience but i want to share something interesting that happened with mw when i was in primary school.
            During those days i used to go to school by foot. One day i was late then my mother told me to used the van that is known to all of you guys those who have the experience to get into it.
            After some minutes i reached my school and the driver of the van was deaf and dumb. So every time i told him to stop the van but he did't do that then i scared and i pull down from the speeding van.
            I fell down in the road and got hurt in my head, leg and hand as well. But the fault was mine because i should't do that thing also he thought he stop the van in the bus stop. Although he could stop it beside my school. So this is one of experience that i had in my childhood.
